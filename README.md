Acqonews is a news application built using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend.
It integrates with the GNews API to fetch the latest news articles and serves them to users in a sleek and responsive design.
This project is deployed on Firebase Free Tier for hosting.

And the problems faced myself are cors that i have solved with the ----->npm install(which installs npm packages)
                                                                   ------>npm i cors(cors installation in the terminal)

 Faced little bit hard to run server.js which is present in the backend and i have implemented connection and i have run having some con's but runned the machine.
 And taken APi from the gnews.io
 And runs it on localhost:5000.
 And uses node_modules
 package.json 
 package-lock.json (which will install directly when we install npm)
Each button now features a neon-frame design, which enhances its appearance.
 And each page have been implemented.
 Api.js for apicallback();
 And implemented in Firebase hosting.
 .env is main for the api key to run.
 

The Feature are the NEWS FETCHING: Fetches news articles using the GNews API.
RESPONSIVE DESIGN: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
BACKEND-FRONTEND INTERGATION: Express.js backend for serving the API and React frontend for displaying news.
